# About

I currently hold a Ph.D. degree in Mechanical Engineering & Materials Science from Wuhan University. My studies focus on: 1) multiscale modelling and computation of soft materials, 2) structure-function relationship of hydrogels, and 3) applications of hydrogels in water-energy nexus and microfluidics.

So far, I have published 19 papers, of which 8 are first/co-first-author publications in top-tier journals such as Adv. Mater., Nano lett., Nano Energy etc., with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=S8aNlhEAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>600+</span></strong></a>. 

My work combined both experimental manufacturing and theoretical computation, I have gained extensive experience in fabrication of hydrogel-based devices and developed a solid foundation in polymer science and computational chemistry. In particular, I am proficient in conducting molecular dynamics (MD) simulations (LAMMPS, Python) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations (VASP, Gaussian) for polymer solution systems.
